		The software system will continue evolving in its whole lift time,and patch is a common way to accomplish the task to update or fix bug and so on.As the software evolving is rapid, how to identify whether a patch for a specific version of software is applicable for an newer version of the same software.We here present a so called patch compatibility analysis to try to fix this problem.It consists of three kind of analysis—program differencing which is used to output the structural difference of the two versions,change impact analysis which is used to analysis the impact of every change including dependency and impacted expressions/statements and so on.And at last,the conflict analysis used to determine whether the two patches’ impact are confictual.
